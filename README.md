Vim provides many different completion tool.
See `:help ins-completion`

This plugin provides a completion function that can be used to complete:

- Jira projects
- Jira issues (matching `^project-\w*`)
- GitHub users (matching `^@\w*`)
- GitHub issues (matching `^#\w*`)
- Emojis (requires junegunn/emoji to be installed)

Completion of Jira issues is limited by Jira search functionality.

Completion of GitHub issues and users is limited to 100 results.
Typically search requires 2 or more characters typed.

Fugitive :GBrowse
-----------------

[vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) provides a `:GBrowse` command which opens the current section of code in your browser,
or provides a link for your clipboard.
This plugin acts as a handler for GitHub based URLs.
Inspired by [vim-rhubarb](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb)

Installation
------------

Requires vim8 or higher.

Depends on [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
Install fugitive.vim then install this plugin the same way.

Depends on [Curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)

Your `curl` needs to be preconfigured to talk to Jira.
This plugin does not do any authentication with Jira itself.

Add the Jira URL to your ~/.vimrc

```vim
let g:jira_domain = 'https://my.jira.domain'
```

GitHub completion requires the creation of a GitHub Personal Access Token.
[Generate a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
with repo permissions and add it to your `.netrc`:

    echo 'machine api.github.com login <user> password <token>' >> ~/.netrc

Emoji completion requires [junegunn/emoji](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-emoji)


To enable the completion function, add something like this to your vimrc:

```vim
augroup bbc
  au!
  au FileType gitcommit,markdown setlocal completefunc=bbc#complete
augroup END
